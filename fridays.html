			Thanks to all who came out to the charity concert last Friday! It sold out
			(1000 seats) and Harvard for Japan has raised almost $40k so far.
			<br>
			This week we will be having a potluck as usual on Friday. See you there!

	We have all been following the tragic events in Japan caused by the Great Tohoku
	Earthquake. 10M-member Keisuke Ishihara has been working day and night to organize
	<a href="http://harvardforjapan.fas.harvard.edu/">Harvard for Japan Week</a>, 
		which started Monday and runs all week. This Friday (3/25) is 
	the <a href="http://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=168914679827243">Mendelssohn, Brahms & Tchaikovsky Japan Benefit Concert</a> featuring card-carrying pro violinist Ryo Goto (Harvard '11). 
	We want to 
	encourage everyone to attend the concert, and we want to attend ourselves, so this week we will not be having a potluck. The concert is open to the public, and tickets are available <a href="http://ofa.fas.harvard.edu/cal/details.php?ID=41678">online</a> (click "Buy Online Now"), in person at the 
	<a href="http://ofa.fas.harvard.edu/boxoffice/">Harvard Box Office</a>, and at the door. Hope to see you there!</p>

<p>The first potluck last week was a great success, 
	thanks to those who came out!</p>
