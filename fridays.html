	We have all been following the tragic events in Japan caused by the Great Tohoku
	Earthquake. 10M-member Keisuke Ishihara has been working day and night to organize
	<a href="http://harvardforjapan.fas.harvard.edu/">Harvard for Japan Week</a>, 
		which started today and runs all week. This Friday (3/25) is 
	the <a href="http://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=168914679827243">Mendelssohn, Brahms & 	 Tchaikovsky Japan Benefit Concert</a> featuring card-carrying pro violinist Ryo Goto (Harvard '11).

Hope to see you there!</p>

<p>The first potluck last week was a great success, 
	thanks to those who came out!</p>
